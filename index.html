<p>These tools are intended to assist <a href="https://www.arcgames.com/en/games/neverwinter">Neverwinter</a> players focused on PS4.  The tools may be out of sync with the Xbox and PC releases.</p>
<table>

<tr><td class="nowrap"><a href="https://two30.github.io/neverwinter-dye/">Dye Pack Comparer</a></td>
<td>This is a tool for doing side-by-side comparisons of dye packs.  Note that the base colour of your equipment determines the result of the dyeing.</td></tr>

<!--tr><td class="nowrap"><a href="https://two30.github.io/neverwinter-combo/">Insignia Bonus Combos</a></td>
<td>This is a tool for trying to match mount insignia bonuses when you have very few insignia.  It's not useful once you have a lot of mount insignia.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="nowrap"><a href="https://two30.github.io/neverwinter-bonding/">Companion Bonding</a></td>
<td>This is a tool for ranking companions.  Setting any of the scores to -1 will exclude all companions that have that aspect.  Note that the "Estimated Speed" is often quite wrong.</td></tr>
<tr><td class="nowrap"><a href="https://two30.github.io/neverwinter-auction/">Auction Category Finder</a></td>
<td>This is a tool for finding the correct category to search for items in the Auction House.  It includes only a subset of items, mainly focusing on packs.</td></tr>

<td>This is an alternative to <a href="https://nwcalc.com/">nwcalc.com</a>'s tool for feats.  However, it shows only the PC release's feats.</td></tr-->
